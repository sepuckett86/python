This is my collection of Python code projects, some for Coursera courses and some for fun.

Fun_practice: code for basic problems I come across such as
  1. Reverse Pig Latin Generator
  2. Calculating % GC content in a DNA sequence
  3. Multiplication of two integers without using the * character following standard by-hand multiplication technique
  4. My take on sorting algorithms: bubble sort and merge sort
